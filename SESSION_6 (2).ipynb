       "'To put it quite simply, this technology (and there are many others like it) is what is often called a “language machine” that uses statistics, reinforcement learning, and supervised learning to index words, phrases, and sentences. While it has no real “intelligence” (it doesn’t know what a word “means” but it knows how it is used), it can very effectively answer questions, write articles, summarize information, and more.\\n\\n\\n\\nEngines like Chat-GPT are “trained” (programmed and reinforced) to mimic writing styles, avoid certain types of conversations, and learn from your questions. In other words, the more advanced models can refine answers as you ask more questions, and then store what it learned for others.\\n\\nWhile this is not a new idea (we’ve had chatbots for a decade, including Siri, Alexa, Olivia, and more), the level of performance in GPT-3.5 (the latest version) is astounding. I’ve asked it questions like “what are the best practices for recruiting” or “how do you build a corporate training program” and it answered pretty well. Yes, the answers were quite elementary and somewhat incorrect, but with training they will clearly get better.'"

       "\"In a world where we can get almost anything with a push or a click, it is no surprise that we have shifted a lot of our social activity to digital space, like chat rooms. People craving social contact can log onto a variety of chat rooms to chat with others who want the same thing. As with every online option, there are advantages and disadvantages to choosing virtual socializing, like chat rooms, over in person. What are chat rooms pros and cons?\\n\\nNot having someone to chat with can be extremely difficult. Sometimes it feels like your friends and family don't understand what you are going through or don't have enough time to chat. Or you might value their perspective but worry about being a burden. Perhaps you have something personal you want to share but don't feel like you can do so with the people you're close to. Or maybe you are someone who doesn't have a ton of friends. At these times and others, online chat rooms can be appealing. However, not everyone has the same experience - or gets the same benefits - when they visit chat rooms.\""
